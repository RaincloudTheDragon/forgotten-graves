## 3.2.8

## Added
- The codebase now leverages [stonecutter-kt](https://github.com/kikugie/stonecutter-kt) to support multiple versions more efficiently.
- The tombstone itself now has collision.

## Fixed
- Fixed an issue where dissociating from a possessed entity was spawning graves (e.g. RAT's Mischief Spy Rat or Requiem's Wandering Soul origin).
